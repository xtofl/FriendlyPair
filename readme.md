# Pairing

I just want to try if I can make some handy pairing
program to be used for youth tournaments.

Maybe web-based, maybe locally run.

# Goals

I want to take the two sides of the tournament
into account: the organisers should have a
friendly backend, and the players should be well
served.

# Technology

Use the (JavaFo)[http://www.rrweb.org/javafo/aum/JaVaFo_AUM.html] engine.
